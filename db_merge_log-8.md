Editor's note: Crowd-sourced <b>detacho</b> primitive story: <b>Detacho</b> (离), the comic top-hat (亠) wearing villain (凶)  who is able to detach his body parts for use as weapons. His most powerful weapons are his elbows (厶), which he can detach, tie together with his belt (冂) and use as detachable boomerang (禸) |  |
