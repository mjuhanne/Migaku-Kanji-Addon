Source	Character	Field	OldValue	NewValue
wk	一	keywords		ground
wk	一	story		This radical consists of a single, horizontal stroke. What's the biggest, single, horizontal stroke? That's the <radical>ground</radical>. Look at the ground, look at this radical, now look at the ground again. Kind of the same, right?
wk	ハ	keywords		fins
wk	ハ	story		Picture a fish. Now picture the fish a little worse, like a child's drawing of the fish. Now erase the fish's body and... you're left with two <radical>fins</radical>! Do you see these two fins? Yeah, you see them.
wk	丶	keywords		drop
wk	丶	story		This little radical is a <radical>drop</radical> of water or some other liquid. Notice how it's only one drop? Sometimes radicals or kanji will have more than one drop, so it's important that you know how to tell them apart.
wk	丿	keywords		slide
wk	丿	story		Close your eyes and imagine you're a kid again. Now open them and... look! It's a <radical>slide</radical>! Imagine little you sliding down this slide over and over, having a great time. Imagination + emotion makes for good memorization!
wk	亅	keywords		barb
wk	亅	story		This radical is shaped like a <radical>barb</radical>. Like the kind you'd see on barb wire. Imagine one of these getting stuck to your arm or your clothes. Think about how much it would hurt with that little hook on the end sticking into you. Say out loud, "Oh dang, I got a barb stuck in me!"
wk	二	keywords		two
wk	二	story		One line plus another line equals <radical>two</radical> lines. This radical represents the number two. Pretty simple, right? Can you guess what three looks like? I bet you can...
wk	亠	keywords		lid
wk	亠	story		This looks like something you'd put on a kettle or a pot, right? It even has a little handle to make sure you don't burn yourself. This is some kind of <radical>lid</radical>.
wk	大	keywords		big
wk	大	story		This radical looks just like a stick figure—more specifically, a really <radical>big</radical> guy with his arms stretched out nice and big. When you see this radical, just think big, because this guy is really BIG!
wk	人	keywords		person
wk	人	story		If you were to draw a <radical>person</radical> with just strokes like you see in kanji, you'd create a stick figure, maybe something like this: <ja>大</ja>. But this is just a person, not someone holding out their arms to show how big they are. So their arms are down, which makes them look like a torso with a pair of legs. Maybe they're walking too, which is why their legs are spread out like that. You can see the person now, can't you?
wk	入	keywords		enter
wk	入	story		Watch out! This isn't the person radical, it's something else. What's the difference? The right side is longer than the left side. And on computers, it usually has that extra part sticking out of the top. It kind of looks like a flap opening to a teepee. And what do you do with an opening? You enter it! That's why this radical is <radical>enter</radical>.
wk	力	keywords		power
wk	力	story		Imagine a guy flexing his arm downward to show off his steroid-pumped arm. It's huge. It's so full of <radical>power</radical>. RARRRWWWRRR!!
wk	勹	keywords		prison
wk	勹	story		This looks like an enclosure of sorts - that's why it's a <radical>prison</radical>. It wraps itself around things and locks them in there. Prisons are pretty scary, even before you imagine one slowly floating down from the sky to trap you.
wk	口	keywords		mouth
wk	口	story		A big, gaping, square hole represents someone opening their giant <radical>mouth</radical> to tell you something stupid.
wk	女	keywords		woman
wk	女	story		This radical looks like a wide person made up of two stacked Xs. Women generally have two XXs for chromosomes, and back in the day they were praised for their wide, child-bearing hips. We may not think of women this way anymore, but way back when Japanese was made, this made them think of a <radical>woman</radical>.
wk	七	keywords		seven
wk	七	story		What does this radical look like? Hmm, nothing much. What about if you turn it upside down? Now does it look like a 7 with a line through it? Close enough to help you to remember that this radical is <radical>seven</radical>, right? Just remember, when you see this radical, flip it over and see what number it looks like. If you can do that, you can remember the meaning!
wk	十	keywords		cross
wk	十	story		This radical looks like a <radical>cross</radical>. I mean, just look at it. Two bars going through each other = a cross!
wk	山	keywords		mountain
wk	山	story		This is a <radical>mountain</radical>. You'll have to add the lines that make up the top of the mountain if you want it more "mountain-like." Also something that might help: sometimes mountains have a couple of smaller peaks coming out the side of the main peak too. Connect the dots and create the mountain in your mind.
wk	川	keywords		river
wk	川	story		This radical already looks like a <radical>river</radical>. See the banks of the river on the side and the flow of the river in the middle? There's even a slight turn in the river too. So when you see this radical, you should think "river."
wk	木	keywords		tree
wk	木	story		Do you see the <radical>tree</radical> in here? It has branches, and then it has the foliage coming down diagonally from it, spreading out like a tree would. That's why this radical is a tree.
wk	工	keywords		construction
wk	工	story		You know those big steel girders that are used for the frame of big buildings? This is like the end of one of those, and have a very distinct shape, just like this radical. These girders are used in construction, which is why this radical means <radical>construction</radical>. Funny thing is, you use these girders to put together buildings just like you're going to use this radical to put together kanji!
wk	九	keywords		nine
wk	九	story		If you look at this radical in just the right way, you'll notice that it kind of looks like the letters "n" and "i" (the "i" comes from the little flippy-up stroke on the right side). What do the letters "n" and "i" start spelling? Why, the word <radical>nine</radical>.
wk	[leaf]	keywords		leaf
wk	[leaf]	story		There's a leaf on top and a stem going down out of it, making it the <radical>leaf</radical> radical. It looks kind of like a lilypad, sitting on top of the water with its stem going down to the bottom where the dirt is.
wk	𠂉	keywords		gun
wk	𠂉	story		This looks a lot like a long <radical>gun</radical> pointing to the right. You have a shoulder rest on the left, and the barrel on the right. Imagine it hanging in a case on the wall in a museum.
wk	日	keywords		sun
wk	日	story		Since there are no circles in Japanese characters, sometimes rectangles or squares have to make do. In this case, this big rectangle is the <radical>sun</radical>. The middle line going through the center horizontally is the equator. Or maybe it's a cloud, moving across the sun. Picture it, but don't actually look at the sun and burn your eyes!
wk	卜	keywords		toe
wk	卜	story		This radical looks just like the katakana character <ja>ト</ja> (to), which sounds like the word <radical>toe</radical>. So when you see <ja>ト</ja>, think toe.
wk	丨	keywords		stick
wk	丨	story		This is a <radical>stick</radical>, sticking out of the ground. It even looks like a stick.
wr	八	story		はち: After you count and smell all <kanji>eight</kanji> of your fins, it's time to put them away. You open a large <reading>hatch</reading> (<ja>はち</ja>) and put them in. This is where you keep your fins, always putting in eight at a time because that's what the boss wants.
wr	八	comment		You've asked him why you can only put eight fins at a time in the hatch, but he never wants to answer. What could be down in the hole that the hatch covers? Why is there a hatch at all? What's with numbers and hatches being mysterious?
wk	八	keywords		eight
wk	八	story		This isn't exactly the same as the <radical>fins</radical> radical, but it's close. Sometimes this will happen (where we have to use a slightly "modified radical" version of the original), so it's good to understand that now, early on. In this case, we have fins. How many fins? <kanji>Eight</kanji> fins. How do you know that? Because you caught four fish with two fins each.
wk	八	comment		Count the fins out in front of you, all the way from one to eight. It'll help if you actually do this. Now smell each fin, and think "Wow, I have to smell all eight of these?" Yes, you do.
wk	八	primitives		ハ
wr	三	story		さん: <kanji>Three</kanji> is the number of chances you get with <reading>San</reading>ta-san (<ja>さん</ja>). He has a list, and when you get to three "naughty things" lines, that's it. You're on Santa-san's three strikes and you're out list.
wr	三	comment		Picture Santa-san sitting at his desk at the North Pole, eating cookies, and marking one, two, then finally three lines next to names. Once the third line appears, the kid doesn't get presents anymore.
wk	三	keywords		three
wk	三	story		This kanji is made up of the ground radical (which also happens to be the kanji for "one") and the radical for two. Combine <radical>one</radical> and <radical>two</radical> together and what do you get? <kanji>Three</kanji>!
wk	三	comment		This one should be pretty self explanatory! Even easier, you can look at this kanji and see it has three straight lines. You know what one looks like. You know what two looks like. So... this is three!
wk	三	primitives		一二
wr	上	story		じょう: Of course when you find a toe <kanji>above</kanji> the ground, you want to know where the toe came from. When you examine it, you see a name written on there. This toe belongs to the local clumsy farmhand, <reading>Jou</reading>rm (<ja>じょう</ja>).
wr	上	comment		<p>Try to remember Jourm, the local farmhand. He is a recurring character that will come up anytime the reading for a kanji is <ja>じょう</ja>.</p><p>He is a very big man, and he wears farmer's clothes. It's important to imagine your version of Jourm as very big, because it will help us to differentiate him from Jo-Anne, who is the character associated with the similar, but shorter reading (and character) <ja>じょ</ja>. Although Jourm will develop as you go through all the <ja>じょう</ja> reading kanji, for now just imagine him as a big, kinda slow dude who works for a local farmer. Also, he only has nine or fewer toes, apparently.</p>
wk	上	keywords		above,up,over
wk	上	story		You find a <radical>toe</radical> on the <radical>ground</radical>. It's weird, because it's <kanji>above</kanji> the ground, not where toes belong.
wk	上	comment		Focus your imagination on how body parts should be buried, not above ground like this. Sure, finding a toe is a little strange, but finding a toe above the ground? Downright silly.
wk	上	primitives		卜一
wr	下	story		か, げ: You keep digging for the <radical>toe</radical> <kanji>below</kanji> the <radical>ground</radical>, and instead of hitting a <radical>toe</radical> you hit something hard and metallic. You keep digging and digging around it, but it's huge. Turns out, you found yourself a <reading>car</reading> (<ja>か</ja>). Keep digging until you unearth the car. Inside, you find the toe you were looking for.
wr	下	comment		There's another useful on'yomi reading that just isn't useful enough for you to learn now. That reading is <ja>げ</ja>, but we're only going to worry about that much, much later when you have to learn one or two vocab words that read <ja>下</ja> as <ja>げ</ja>. That's the problem with really common kanji - too many readings.
wk	下	keywords		below,down,under,beneath
wk	下	story		There's a <radical>toe</radical> <kanji>below</kanji> <radical>ground</radical>.
wk	下	comment		So, where is the <radical>toe</radical> now? It's <kanji>below</kanji> ground. Imagine yourself digging it out, and thinking... ugh, why does it have to be <kanji>below</kanji> ground like this? So irritating. Will I be able to sew it back on in time to save it?
wk	下	primitives		一卜
wk	土	keywords		dirt
wk	土	story		There's a cross drawn on the ground, making this <radical>dirt</radical>. You can draw anything in the dirt, it just happens to be a cross this time. Imagine drawing a cross in the dirt with your finger. Feel the dirt get stuck under your fingernail and never forget.
wk	刀	keywords		sword
wk	刀	story		If you look at this radical, it looks like the bottom part of a <radical>sword</radical>—the handle, more specifically. This radical also looks a lot like the power radical (<ja>力</ja>), so don't get them confused. It's missing the little nubbin at the top, because 90% of the power comes from the sword to cut your enemies down (which is why the sword radical is 90% of the power radical).
wk	𠂇	keywords		narwhal
wk	𠂇	story		This radical looks like the katakana character <ja>ナ</ja> (na), which we're going to say stands for <radical>narwhal</radical>. Plus, this radical kind of looks like a narwhal, right? The body and head on the bottom, and the single majestic narwhal horn coming out the top, shooting up out of the water and into the air. Oh, and don't confuse this radical with treasure. The sideways line for narwhal (<ja>ナ</ja>) is horizontal, the sideways line for treasure is at more of a downward angle (<ja>メ</ja>), like an "X."
wk	丁	keywords		street
wk	丁	story		There's a barb under the ground, holding it in place. This is actually a <radical>street</radical>. All streets have to be secured to the ground with barbs so that they don't slide all over the place. If you tried to pick up the asphalt streets we have today, you'd still find barbs under the ground to keep them there. The more you know! ⭐
wk	儿	keywords		legs
wk	儿	story		This radical already looks like a pair of <radical>legs</radical>. There's even feet on these legs (unlike the fins radical, which you learned earlier). That's how you know these are legs and not fins (or something else).
wk	冂	keywords		head
wk	冂	conflicting_keywords		h:head
wk	冂	story		This is the kind of <radical>head</radical> a child might draw—can you imagine it with eyes, nose, mouth, and ears too? Whoever's head this is, it's really square. Maybe it's the head of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants_(character)" target="_blank">famous spongy cartoon character</a>. Hmm.
wk	又	keywords		stool
wk	又	story		This looks just like a fold-out <radical>stool</radical>, amiright?
wk	乂	keywords		treasure
wk	乂	story		This radical is <radical>treasure</radical> because "X marks the spot," as they say. Doesn't it look like the X on a pirate treasure map? You want to go find that treasure now, right?!
wk	千	keywords		thousand
wk	千	story		You're in a room, surrounded by slides. Down off the slides tumble cross after cross after cross. They're bouncing in and hitting you in the face, the arm, everywhere... With each cross comes a voice yelling, "ONE! TWO! THREE HUNDRED! FIVE HUNDRED!" and so on. You are worried it will never end, because you're starting to drown in the crosses. Then the voice yells out ONE <radical>THOUSAND</radical> and they stop. Still, you can't move. Think about all the numbers being called out, and keep wondering if it'll be the last one. Feel the relief you'd feel if it stops on a thousand, because you won't be buried anymore. The thousand crosses are covering you entirely, over your head, but because they're crosses you can still breathe.
wk	夕	keywords		evening
wk	夕	story		Do you see the prison and drop radicals making up this radical? This prison is holding onto a drop because it's the <radical>evening</radical>. Evening air does a better job of holding on to drops of liquid like this, which is why everything is covered in dew in the morning.
wk	子	keywords		child
wk	子	story		This radical is made up of two barbs and one ground radical. If there are barbs on the ground, whom (especially) do you want to avoid that area? You want your <radical>child</radical> to avoid it, since children are so careless and often don't wear shoes. Imagine how bad you'd feel if you let a child walk around on top of these barbs! Pretty bad, I imagine.
wk	小	keywords		small
wk	小	story		You have fins and you have a barb. A fish that you can stick an entire barb through like this would have to be really <radical>small</radical>, since it's sticking through the whole fish body (which you can imagine by basing the body off the size of the fins compared to the already small barb.)
wk	弓	keywords		bow
wk	弓	story		This radical looks like a fancy composite <radical>bow</radical> people would use to shoot at targets and definitely not any normal living animals. See how the middle part is being pulled back? Imagine holding this bow and firing it at a target shaped like a giant alligator-crab monster.
wk	尸	keywords		flag
wk	尸	story		See the <radical>flag</radical> in this radical? There's a pole with a flag on the end of it, blowing in the wind. Basically, this radical looks just like a flag.
wk	彡	keywords		hair
wk	彡	story		These three streaks flowing off to the side are three strands of hair. Pretty easy to see and remember, right?
wk	五	keywords		five
wk	五	story		If you use your imagination, this radical actually looks like the number "5." You have to remove the vertical line in the bottom left, but once you do that, you have an easy way to remember that this radical means <radical>five</radical>.
wk	天	keywords		heaven
wk	天	story		There is a two radical and a person radical. The first level of a person's life is on earth. The second level (this level, which is why there's a two radical here) is in heaven. So when you see a person at level 2, you know they're in <radical>heaven</radical>.
wk	手	keywords		hand
wk	手	story		This one's a little tough to picture, but I believe in you. The barb in the middle is the wrist/arm. Then, there are four regular fingers coming off of it and then one big thumb (the slide radical at the top). So you have four fingers, a thumb, and a wrist. This is what makes up your crazy looking <radical>hand</radical>.
wk	文	keywords		writing
wk	文	story		This looks like a stool with a lid on it, but it's actually a <radical>writing</radical> desk. Do you see it? It's a nice, quiet place for writing. You can even see the pen sticking up in the middle. Wouldn't you want to do your writing here?
wk	月	keywords		moon
wk	月	story		The <radical>moon</radical> is actually made of the sun, but it has little legs coming off of it leaning towards the left. Why? Because the moon is always running away from the sun as fast as it can. It doesn't want to get caught on fire, so it has to run to stay ahead!
wk	止	keywords		stop
wk	止	story		There's a giant toe and a stick in the ground in front of you. You're driving your car toward them, but you don't see them until your lights hit them. What would these things cause you to do? Most likely <radical>stop</radical> your car right away.
wk	水	keywords		water
wk	水	story		There are drops of liquid coming out of both sides of this barb. You can imagine the barb being stuck into the ground then pulled out. When it is, <radical>water</radical> comes gushing out of both sides! That's why this radical is water.
wk	火	keywords		fire
wk	火	story		See the person radical here? It's got things coming off of it... what are those things—OH MY GOD IT'S <radical>FIRE</radical>!!! Help, help! Put the fire out!
wk	犬	keywords		dog
wk	犬	story		Remember the big guy that helped you remember the big radical? Now the big guy has something on his shoulder... what is that? You look and see that he has a <radical>dog</radical> up there, perched as if it were a parrot or a cat or something. Dogs aren't supposed to be up on people's shoulders like that, but for him? It works!
wk	王	keywords		king
wk	王	story		This radical is not something anyone can have. Only a <radical>king</radical> can wear this crown upon his head. This radical is the sign of kings. Imagine your favorite king wearing this on their head. It's a pretty distinctive shape—I think you can do it.
wk	中	keywords		middle
wk	中	story		There's a stick going right through the <radical>middle</radical> of someone's mouth! Imagine that mouth being yours. Measure the placement of the stick. Perfectly aligned, right in the middle. That's amazing, though to be honest, you probably have bigger problems than measuring the location of this stick in your mouth.
wk	本	keywords		book
wk	本	story		There's a cut right at the base of this tree. Why would someone cut down a tree? To make a <radical>book</radical> out of it! Imagine living in the old days when you'd have to cut down a tree yourself to write or read a book.
wk	田	keywords		rice paddy
wk	田	story		Rice paddies are made up of fields with irrigation lines going between them. See the four rice paddies with water flowing between and around them? That's why this radical is <radical>rice paddy</radical>.
wk	白	keywords		white
wk	白	story		Add a drop of the sun to something and it will turn it <radical>white</radical>. The sun is really strong, so even a single drop will burn anything white. Why do you think so many beaches are white? Even the drops of sunblock you use to stop the sun's rays is white. So when you think of sun drops, think white.
wk	目	keywords		eye
wk	目	story		See the iris in the middle of the eyeball? Remember that there are no round things in kanji, so square things take their place. That makes this a pretty realistic, square <radical>eye</radical>. You just have to squint with your real eyes a bit.
wk	石	keywords		stone
wk	石	story		There's a leaf growing out of a square thing (which is normally a mouth, but not this time). The leaf is growing out of a <radical>stone</radical>. I mean, obviously, because leaves don't grow out of mouths. I hope. Anyway, picture a stone in the middle of nature with a leaf growing out of it or just behind it and you'll never forget this radical!
wk	立	keywords		stand
wk	立	story		Two sticks are propping up a lid. By doing this, they're making it <radical>stand</radical> up.
wk	牛	keywords		cow
wk	牛	story		There's a cross and a gun, with the gun going through the cross. You're using the cross to stabilize your gun, because you need to shoot a <radical>cow</radical> for dinner. You bring your cross because you need to bless the cow once you've killed it (and it's also a good stand for your gun). Poor cow.
wk	厶	keywords		private
wk	厶	story		This is a little triangle that's almost completely closed off. When you want to be alone, you hide in a place where you can be in <radical>private</radical>. That's why this is the private radical. You're closing yourself off to the rest of the world, with just a little peephole.
wr	了	story		りょう: How does the fish lure maker test his newly <kanji>finish</kanji>ed lure out? The one he just finished? He gets in a <reading>row</reading> (<ja>りょう</ja>) boat and rows out into the sea.
wr	了	comment		Make him think that he can’t just use his new lure on the side of the lake / ocean / whatever. He has to get out there, but unfortunately all he has is a crappy row boat. Imagine the row boat being terrible, leaky, and dangerous, which is why you’re surprised when he goes for it. That’s a terrible row boat to use! If you do this, you'll focus your mind on the rowboat part of things, which will help you to remember the reading of this kanji.
wk	了	keywords		finish,complete,end
wk	了	conflicting_keywords		h:finish,h:end
wk	了	story		Think about it this way. There is a famous fishing lure inventor, working on his best work ever. He’s old, and he’s been trying to make the best fishing lure for the last 50 years, and knows this will be his last invention. Then he figures it out. He takes one <radical>barb</radical>, and connects the end of it to the top of another <radical>barb</radical>. When he does this, he knows his work is finally <kanji>finish</kanji>ed.
wk	了	comment		Make sure you look at this amazing fishing lure too - hold it in your hand, see the two barbs fused together. Think about how strange this lure is. Is this really the best in the world? Will this really finish all other fishing lures?

Don't tell me it doesn't melt your heart just thinking about it.</p><p>Alternatively, you could also look at this kanji and think of Maru inside of a box, with his little tail sticking out of it.

wk	六	keywords		six
wk	六	story		Just imagine a beast with a <radical>lid</radical> for a head and <radical>fins</radical> for feet, running around looking as insane as possible (really imagine it!). When it runs up to you, it shows you the top of its lid-head. On it is written the numbers 666. Why? Because it's a spawn of the devil, and the number <kanji>six</kanji> is the devil's number.
wk	六	comment		Imagine this beast doing various crazy things, the crazier the better (to help you remember). Make sure all these things are associated with the devil and the devil's number (<kanji>six</kanji>), so you can remember the meaning of this kanji.
wk	六	primitives		亠ハ
wr	円	story		えん: What does the word <kanji>yen</kanji> sound like? It sounds like <ja>えん</ja>. Why? because back in the day, Japanese used to have a "ye" sound, but now it doesn't. Instead, it's an "e" sound, which is why yen = <ja><reading>えん</reading></ja>!
wr	円	comment		Picture these <kanji>round</kanji> <ja>えん</ja> in your mind. Maybe look some up online too, just to be safe.
wk	円	keywords		yen,round,circle
wk	円	conflicting_keywords		h:round
wk	円	story		The combination of radicals for this kanji may not be obvious at first, but if you look carefully you'll see it. The <radical>lid</radical> is inside the <radical>head</radical> for this kanji because it's holding something in. Imagine the top of someone's head being closed by a lid. Open that lid up and peer inside... it's full of <kanji>yen</kanji> coins, the currency of Japan!
wk	円	comment		Another thing that will help is to associate the word <kanji>round</kanji> to this kanji, because it has both of these meanings. Both are right, and if you learn one that's better than not learning either, but maybe if you think about how round the coins themselves are inside this person's head, you'll remember this one too.

You are frantically looking for the <kanji>exit</kanji> before you freeze to death. The most important thing is to find the exit from this mountain range - your life depends on it.
wk	出	comment		In your imagination, really feel like your life depends on getting out. The important part is the feeling of "needing to get out of the mountain pass." If you have this feeling, you'll be more likely to remember that this kanji means exit, because that's what you want to do when you see this kanji.

wk	々	story		<p>This is a strange kanji because it doesn't really mean anything at all. In fact, what it does is it repeats the kanji that comes before it. For example: <ja>人々</ja> is actually <ja>人人</ja>. This kanji shows up whenever there's a repeating kanji, because it's often easier to write than writing a more complicated kanji twice. That's why this kanji is the <kanji>repeater</kanji>. It repeats what comes before it.</p><p>To remember that this kanji is the repeater, though, think of a <radical>drop</radical> of water dripping into a <radical>prison</radical>. Drip drop drip drop.

Basically, there’s a lump (the heart) in the middle, and three lines which make up the arteries that go in and out of the heart to keep you alive. This radical shows up a lot, so it shouldn’t be too hard to learn it as you go along. Remember, lump (heart) plus arteries equals a heart… like, a real heart, not the fake, pretty kind.

wk	広	story		The <radical>canopy</radical> you use in <radical>private</radical> is very <kanji>wide</kanji>.
wk	広	comment		You want your private canopy to be wide so you can sprawl out under it is as much as you want. No one's going to come in and tell you to close your legs or sit up straight. So it can be as wide as you like!

wk	寸	keywords		measurement
wk	寸	story		Have you ever used one of those math compasses? This looks just like one of those because this is the <radical>measurement</radical> radical. Compasses are used to measure things, just like this.
wk	亻	keywords		leader
wk	亻	story		This radical technically means person (like <ja>人</ja>), but we're going to shift the meaning a little bit. It's kind of like the person radical, but it's taller and skinnier, standing above the rest of those peons. That's why this is a <radical>leader</radical>, not a regular old person.
wk	冖	keywords		forehead
wk	冖	story		Sure, this <radical>forehead</radical> is a bit square, but that's because it's Frankenstein's Monster's forehead. Also, did you notice that this is just the top part of the head (<ja>冂</ja>) radical? This is just the forehead part of that!
wk	也	keywords		alligator
wk	也	story		See the mouth and teeth of this <radical>alligator</radical>, which is facing to the right? You wouldn't want to get your hand stuck in there, that's for sure.
wk	宀	keywords		roof
wk	宀	story		This is a <radical>roof</radical>. You know it's a roof and not a forehead because there's a little chimney sticking out of the top. And foreheads definitely don't have chimneys.
wk	弋	keywords		ceremony
wk	弋	story		This radical looks like a person with a long dress or train running behind them. That's because it's a bride or groom going to their wedding <radical>ceremony</radical>! You usually have to wear a long dress or a cape if you're at a ceremony. So when you see this radical, think of all the different ceremonies you might have to go to in your life and what you'll need to wear.
wk	礻	keywords		spirit
wk	礻	conflicting_keywords		h:spirit
wk	礻	story		This looks just like the katakana character for ne. Ne for necromancer! That makes this a <radical>spirit</radical>, brought back from the grave. OooooOOoooOoo!
wk	支	keywords		branch

wk	气	keywords		energy
wk	气	story		This radical is shaped kind of like a dam. See the wall and the water pushing over the top? If this radical is a dam, then it must create a ton of <radical>energy</radical> as well!
wk	世	keywords		world
wk	世	conflicting_keywords		h:world
wk	世	story		There are no circles in kanji, remember? So imagine that these angles are really circles. A little circle in a big circle, with a line running through them. Why, it's the <radical>world</radical>. The world looks just like this, with continents on the globe and a line is the equator. Can you see it?
wk	皿	keywords		plate
wk	皿	story		This is a few <radical>plate</radical>s drying on a rack. They're stacked together in a line. Imagine reaching out and grabbing one of those plates for yourself.
wk	竹	keywords		bamboo
wk	竹	story		See how tall the stalks are with little bushy things at the top? It kind of looks like <radical>bamboo</radical>, if you use your imagination.
wk	糸	keywords		thread
wk	糸	story		There is something small in some poop. You lean in, carefully pull it out, and realize it's a <radical>thread</radical>. Why is there some thread in this small poop? Because it's cat poop. And cats love to eat thread when you aren't looking. And floss and hoodie strings and mouse tails. But this poop just has thread in it.
wk	耳	keywords		ear
wk	耳	story		This radical is a bit more elaborate than the eye, though similar. In fact, if you go blind, your <radical>ear</radical>s become one of your new senses of sight, which is why this is like another, somewhat modified, eye. You'll even notice little lines sticking out of the eye. That's because ears stick out more than eyes (<ja>目</ja>), which is why this radical is the ear radical.
wk	虫	keywords		insect
wk	虫	story		There is something private in your mouth. You're keeping it private because you don't want other people to judge you. Why? Because it's an <radical>insect</radical>. You like to eat insects, but society seems to think it's wrong. Don't worry, friend. Someday the rest of the world will embrace eating insects like you have.
wk	艹	keywords		flowers
wk	艹	story		See the little things sticking out of the ground? Those little things are pretty little <radical>flowers</radical>. You know they're flowers and not, say, grass, because they're spaced out. You'll learn grass later, and it will be less spaced out, but somewhat similar to this, so keep that in mind!
wk	見	keywords		see
wk	見	story		There's an eyeball on top of some legs. When your eyes get taken places (on legs, in this case), your eyes are <radical>see</radical>ing those things. That's why this radical means see.
wk	赤	keywords		red
wk	赤	story		There are some legs and fins under the dirt. Imagine yourself looking at all of these severed limbs... there's blood everywhere. No matter how deep you dig, everything is stained <radical>red</radical>.
wk	車	keywords		car
wk	車	story		Doesn't this look like a top-down view of the frame of a <radical>car</radical>? There are the rods that make up the base of the car and things for the wheels to go on. That's why this radical is the car radical.
wk	貝	keywords		shellfish
wk	貝	story		There's a giant eye on top of some fins. Imagine this giant eye to be on top of a clam or a mussel. It has little fins, which it runs around on, escaping from your every attempt to capture it. That's why this is the <radical>shellfish</radical> radical.
wk	足	keywords		foot
wk	足	story		Do you see the dude doing a flying dragon kick to the right? What does he hit the target with? Obviously it's his <radical>foot</radical>.
wk	不	keywords		not
wk	不	conflicting_keywords		h:not
wk	不	story		If you see this radical in a kanji, you'll want to think of the opposite of whatever other radicals there are. It looks a lot like "below," but guess what? It's <radical>not</radical> the below radical. It's just not.
wk	士	keywords		samurai
wk	士	story		The <radical>samurai</radical> radical looks a lot like the dirt radical. The difference is in the top horizontal line. For samurai, the top is longer because he's holding swords. Dirt can't really hold anything because its arms are too short. So when you see this radical, think: long arms for some long swords. That's a samurai!
wk	米	keywords		rice
wk	米	story		Not to be confused with a rice paddy (<ja>田</ja>). This is just raw <radical>rice</radical>, like the grain that grows out of the ground when rice is raw and fresh. When rice is particularly ripe, it'll kind of look like this at the top of the stalks. See the long leaves with the little rice tufts at the top? That's why this radical is "rice."
wk	彳	keywords		loiter
wk	彳	story		The leader (<ja>ｲ</ja>) radical has a little something extra on top of him, holding him down, holding him back. It's causing him to wait... it's causing him to <radical>loiter</radical>.

wk	巴	conflicting_keywords		h:bed
wk	巴	story		You'll have to complete the line on the right side in your mind, but see the rectangle <radical>bed</radical> and the pillows? This is totally a bed. That missing line is where you pulled back the sheets when you got up this morning.
wk	兀	keywords		pi
wk	兀	story		Obviously, this looks just like the good ol' 3.14 something-something all people are supposed to learn about. It's the math symbol that has to do with circles... <radical>pi</radical>!
wk	厂	keywords		cliff
wk	厂	story		See the <radical>cliff</radical>? It's facing towards the west. What ocean is to your west? That's the direction this cliff is facing.
wk	主	keywords		master
wk	主	story		This king has a drop of water floating above his head. That's because he's not just a king, he's the <radical>master</radical> of water. Master of elements. Master of ALL THINGS!
wk	乚	keywords		umbrella
wk	乚	conflicting_keywords		h:umbrella
wk	乚	story		Do you know how the bottom of an <radical>umbrella</radical> is shaped? It has a hook that curls around for the handle. So when you see this radical, you should think of the bottom of an umbrella, which will help you remember that it means umbrella.
wk	[slingshot]	keywords		beggar
wk	[slingshot]	story		Doesn't this look like someone on their knees, holding their hands out (clasped) and begging for something (money, their life, etc.)? That's why this radical is known as the <radical>beggar</radical>.
wk	丷	keywords		horns
wk	丷	story		Can you see the <radical>horns</radical>? You could put these horns on anything. Donkeys, people, monkeys, and so on. That's exactly what we'll be doing when we learn kanji that have horns too.

wk	他	comment		Imagine different groups of leaders - they're all dressed nice and normal. Then, off to the side are the leaders who are leaders of bears, cats, alligators, and narwhals... they're the <kanji>other</kanji> ones, no matter how you look at it.

As long as you feel disconcerted that the leader isn’t tall enough, you should be able to remember that you need to attach something to the leader to make them tall enough. The fact that you’re attaching another head to the top of the leader's head is pretty weird too, and should help you to remember the meaning.
