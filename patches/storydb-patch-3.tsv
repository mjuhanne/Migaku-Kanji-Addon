h	並	comment	The primitive meaning remains the same as that of the kanji, but special attention has to be given to the varieties of shape this element can undergo. It is the most difficult one you will meet in this book. When it appears BENEATH its relative primitive, the top three strokes are omitted, though the third horizontal stroke may be doubled up with the bottom horizontal stroke of the element above it ([row-bottom] as in 繊 or 湿). ATOP its relative primitive, it can keep its kanji shape. When it does not, the top three strokes are removed and all of them are replaced BELOW the primitive's bottom line ([in_a_row_upside_down] as in 業). We shall acknowledge this latter transformation by changing its meaning to <i>upside down in a row</i>. Editor's note: You can use the row 並 primitive as described by Heisig, or you can switch to use it's basic components 业 (spikes) and 䒑 (grass, weeds) which were not included in RTK. You can decide case by case for each kanji these elements are introduced in.

h	旡	story	If you draw this character once, you will see that its first three strokes resemble the form for receipt (except that the second stroke ends more parallel to the first), with its last stroke stretched to form the first of the two human legs. From this we give it its meaning of a <b>waitress</b> (who should not be confused with the waiter back in FRAME 976 侍). [4]	["This primitive is too simple to draw to bother with looking for other primitive elements hidden inside it\u2014except perhaps for the last stroke that forms the second of two <i>human legs</i>. From this we give it its meaning of a <b>waitress</b> (who should not be confused with the waiter back in frame 1050).", "Oddly, the element on its own is drawn with four strokes but with five strokes when it appears in another kanji. [4]"]
h	𡗗	story	The element for <i>bushes</i> has an extra stroke added (drawn from the point where the second and fifth strokes intersect when it "encloses" something beneath, otherwise from the point where the fourth and fifth strokes intersect) to give the image of the crutches Japanese gardeners use to hold up a tree that is being bent into shape. From there it is but a short leap to the small <b>bonsai</b> plants that imitate this art in miniature. [5]	The element for <i>bushes</i> has an extra stroke added (drawn down from the middle of the second stroke when it "encloses" something beneath, otherwise from the point where the third and fourth strokes intersect) to give the image of the crutches Japanese gardeners use to hold up a tree that is being bent into shape. From there it is but a short leap to the small <b>bonsai</b> plants that imitate this art in miniature. [5]
h	頑	story	This character refers to the block<i>headed</i>, persistent <b>stubbornness</b> of one who sticks to an idea or a plan just the way it was at the <i>beginning</i>, without letting anything that comes up along the way alter things in the least. The explanation makes "sense," but is hard to remember because the word "<i>beginning</i> "is too abstract. Back up to the image we used two frames ago - Adam and Eve in their Eden - and try again: The root of all <b>stubbornness</b> goes back to the <i>beginning</i>, with two brothers each <b>stubbornly</b> defending his own way of life and asking their God to bless it favorably. Abel stuck to agriculture, Cain to animal-raising. Picture these two with their giant, swelled <i>heads</i>, each vying for the favors of heaven, a <b>stubborn</b> grimace on their faces.

h	鬱	story	Learning this character will take a little doing. Before we start, it is a good idea to keep the key word distinct from <i>melancholy</i> (Frame 663), with which it combines to create the psychological condition of depression (a metaphor based on the hollow or sinking of the material <i>depression</i> we met in Frame 1421). The picture of <b>gloom</b> begins with a small <i>grove</i> of <i>tree</i>s, under which we see a <i>crown</i> made out of used <i>tin cans</i>. Next (the lower half of the kanji) we find a combination that appears only a few times in modern characters and only once in those treated in the volumes of <i>Remembering the Kanji</i>. It is composed of a <i>shovel</i> with a <i>sheaf</i> dotted with small <i>drops</i> on all sides. Think of it as a large scoop <i>shovel</i> attached to the front of a bulldozer, whose driver is singing: ♪ "Bulldozing in the <i>sheaves</i>, bulldozing in the <i>sheaves</i>..." ♪ The <i>drops</i> represent the chaff flying about as the <i>sheaves</i> are tossed about by the heavy machinery. There is <i>someone sitting on the ground</i> alongside, watching as the machinery makes its way around the neighboring farmland - and it's you, wearing your <i>tin-can crown</i>. You feel overwhelmed by the impending doom as the invasion of agro-business draws closer and closer to the <i>grove</i>, the only patch of woods that remains of what once was a vast forest. The whole scene represents a re-<i>shaping</i> of the natural environment that brings the heavy weight of <b>gloom</b> down upon you. A bit much, perhaps, but there are enough elements to allow for any number of other combinations.	["Learning this character will take a little doing.
