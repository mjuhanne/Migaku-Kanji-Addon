cs	兆	primitive_keywords		hairy legs
cs	兆	story		This is a clear pictograph of <b>hairy legs</b>. It's recommended to use it as primitive keyword instead of <b>portent</b> because it connects quite well with the Koohi stories of other kanji characters that this primitive is part of. Alternatively you might choose <b>shiny legs</b> keyword using sparkler ([sparkler]) primitive but in that case you are on your own to make up the stories.

cs	桃	story		<b>Peach tree</b> is the <i>tree</i> (木) that has <i>hairy</i> (兆) fruits.
cs	桃	comment		Fun fact: The hairy stuff (fuzz) on peach is actually a defense mechanism which protects the fruit from insects and other pests. The tiny little hairs are irritating for some bugs. Nectarines and peaches are nearly the same genetically, but a gene variant between the two causes peaches to have a fuzzy skin and nectarines to have a smooth skin.

cs	棋	story		Shogi () and chess pieces are made of wood whereas Go uses stones.

cs	亶	story		This crowd-sourced primitive tells the story of the <b>Groundhog Day</b> (1993 movie):  The mayor in his <i>top hat</i> (亠) announces the prediction of the arrival of spring (depending on the groundhogs behavior).

cs	梅	comment		This kanji refers to the tree and the fruits of the species Prunus mume. Its common names include Chinese plum, Japanese plum and Japanese apricot.   Take care not to confuse with kanji 李 (damson, lat. Prunus salicina) which confusingly also is called Chinese plum, Japanese plum. Note that 李 (Li) is mainly used as a common surname in Asia.

cs	李	comment		["This kanji refers to the tree and fruits of Prunus salicina (\u674e, \u30b9\u30e2\u30e2). Confusingly it also has the same common names (Japanese plum, Chinese plum\u200b) as \u6885 (\u3046\u3081, Japanese plum, lat. Prunus mume). To add confusion, Heisig's keyword of choice (<b>damson</b>) actually refers to Prunus domestica (another subspecies of plum tree).", "However \u674e (Li) is mainly used as a common surname in Asia. According to Wikipedia it is the second-most common surname in China as of 2018, the second-most common surname in Hong Kong, the most common surname in Macau and the 5th most common surname in Taiwan, where it is usually romanized as \"Lee\".  For this reason and to prevent confusion with \u6885 we give this kanji another keyword: <b>Mr Lee</b>."]
