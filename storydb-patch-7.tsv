cs	禾	primitive_keywords		bread
cs	禾	comment		Because this primitive is used in over 100 kanjis it's advisable to add one more primitive keyword: <b>bread</b>.  Not only it's possible to swap <b>wheat</b> for white <b>bread</b> in many cases without affecting the story negatively, but on the contrary it often makes the story even more vivid. For example 稼 (earn income = bringing home your daily bread).

cs	翏	primitive_keywords		albatross
cs	翏	story		Imagine an <b>albatross</b> with its wide <i>wings</i> (羽 / 羽) strutting along the beach in an endless crowd of <i>parasols</i> (㐱).  Is this a good sign or a bad omen? We don't know yet - that depends on the story of each kanji this primitive is used in!
cs	翏	comment		Story of the <b>albatross</b> (from Wikipedia): In the poem <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i>, an <b>albatross</b> follows a ship setting out to sea, which is considered a sign of good luck. However, the titular mariner shoots the albatross with a crossbow, an act that will curse the ship and cause it to suffer terrible mishaps. Unable to speak due to lack of water, the ship's crew let the mariner know through their glances that they blame him for their plight and they tie the bird around his neck as a sign of his guilt. From this arose the image of an albatross around the neck as metaphor for a burden that is difficult to escape.

h	躇	comment	The old form here is the element puppet which forms part of the primitive for renowned here. The difference is the addition of a final drop. This has generally disappeared today, as in the following examples: 堵, 渚, 曙, 箸 (old forms) vs 堵, 渚, 曙, 箸 (modern abbreviations).  Editor's note: It's not possible to show the old vs new versions due to discrepancies by fonts used.	["The old form here is the element puppet which forms part of the primitive for renowned here.

cs	卂	story		["The meaning of this kanji is <b>to fly rapidly</b> so we can conveniently assign it a keyword <b>needletail</b>. This references <i>white-throated needletail</i>, a one of the fastest birds on this planet. ", "The <i>hook</i> (\u2e84) looks like a pictograph of the bird looking from the side. It's so aerodynamic that its head (which would be on the left side) is completely flush with its torso and thus cannot be distinguished. The little kink at the end of its wing is the winglet seen on many modern airplanes.  Finally there's the <i>needle</i> (\u5341) which has detached itself from the tail because the bird really is so fast!"]
cs	迅	story		["The white-throated <i>needletail</i> (\u5342 ), one of the fastest birds on this planet, is soaring <b>swiftly</b> high up on top of the highway with a maximum speed of 169 km/h (105 mph). Of course it wouldn't need to follow any <i>roads</i> (\u2ecc) and can blast through any crossroads (\u8fbb) but the mischievous bird just likes to make fun of other voyagers stuck in traffic jams. ", "Fun fact: The white-throated <i>needletail</i> (\u5342 ) actually belongs to <b>swifts</b> (a family of birds) although this kanji is unrelated."]
